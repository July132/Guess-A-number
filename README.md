# Guess-A-Number-Game

Console based game made with Python.
## Project Goals âš½
A simple game project to practice Python skills and simulate the game "Guess A Number".

## Solution ðŸ¤”
A player enters an input of a number between 1 and 100 (must be integer). Then a number is generated by the computer.
The code compares if the number chosen is the same as the one that was generated. If it is not, the program will print
out if the number is higher or lower.
